# MDX: Tuples and Sets Explained Simply

## 1 Tuple
- Imagine you are picking **one thing from each box**.  
- For example, you have:  

**Box 1:** Months → January, February  
**Box 2:** Fruits → Apples, Oranges  

A **tuple** is when you pick **one from each box** at the same time.  

- Example tuple:  
```

(January, Apple)

```
- This is like saying: “I want **January AND Apple together**.”  
- In MDX, tuples are written with parentheses: `(Member1, Member2)`

---

## 2 Set
- Now imagine you want **many tuples together** — like a list of choices.  
- That’s a **set**.  
- Example set of tuples:  
```

{ (January, Apple), (February, Orange), (January, Orange) }

```
- Curly braces `{}` mean “this is a **collection of tuples**.”  

---

## 3 In MDX Tables
- A **tuple** points to **one cell** in the cube (one exact value)  
- A **set** points to **many cells** (a group of values)
```
